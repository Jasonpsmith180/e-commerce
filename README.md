# E-commerce Back End

## Description
E-commerce has taken over the internet and if your business isn't competing in the e-commerce world you could get left behind. But fear not because I have developed an E-commerce backend for any site. The customer facing part of e-commerce is important to attract customers to buy your product but it is the backend that is doing all the heavy lifting. This project uses express, mysql, and sequelize to create a functioning backend for any e-commerce site. Because it is just the backend though you will need an interfacing program like Insomnia to test out all the routes. See the video demonstration beloW!

## Installation
To install the application simply clone the repository and install the dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize dependencies. Also install Insomnia to make all of the CRUD requests.

## Usage
This is an open source project so feel free to use this to support your front-end site or use Insomnia to interface with the database without the front end!

## Contribution
If you have an idea to make this project better you are more than welcome to contribute and improve it for future users!

## Tests
Testing out the CRUD routes is really the only test for this project. If you have the dependecies and a database interfacing program like Insomnia installed you should be good to go!
